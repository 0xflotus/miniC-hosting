### [Staring](https://github.com/vasyop/miniC-hosting) this repo helps.

It's clear that a lot of people would be interested to see this work completed, so consider spreading the word (if you the "reach" to do so, as I am not a social media person).

Please know that this is a side project and that I am working full time and I also have my masters degree classes on weekends.

I very much enjoyed working on this project up until now, and it will get done for sure, seeing how well it was received.

I want to devote as much time as I can to working on this, so I quickly sketched up a patreon account.

I haven't figured details so there's a lot of missing stuff over there.
